    ///
    /// Checks mechanical, objective facts about skill files *as
    /// published artifacts*, and deliberately nothing about the writing:
    /// no length ceiling, no line cap, no required section, no opinion
    /// about tone or structure. Skills carry judgment rather than
    /// prescription; the only things worth gating are the facts that
    /// decide whether a skill loads at all and whether it is safe to
    /// have published.
    ///
    /// The predecessor gated on a description character ceiling no skill
    /// in the corpus could meet, so it was red from its first run. A gate
    /// nobody can pass teaches contributors to read red as normal, which
    /// is worse than no gate.
    ///
    /// Scope, by rule:
    ///
    /// - `skill-corpus-empty` — the whole repository, once. Fails closed:
    ///   a corpus that silently moved or vanished must not read as a
    ///   clean scan.
    /// - `skill-frontmatter`, `skill-identity` — every `<dir>/SKILL.md`.
    /// - `skill-links`, `skill-machine-path`, `skill-internal-rule-id`,
    ///   `skill-unsanctioned-reference` — every `.md` file in the
    ///   repository.
    ///
    /// Layout-agnostic: skills are found by locating `SKILL.md` at any
    /// depth, so a repository whose skills sit at the root and one that
    /// nests them under `Skills/` both work with no configured path.
    ///
