    /// The trust anchor pins the CI source repositories a workflow
    /// revision may execute (the ratified Q3 design,
    /// swift-institute/.github#461). Those pins are *generated*: measured
    /// from the source repositories and written into the workflow by the
    /// emitter that owns them,
    /// `Institute.ContinuousIntegration.Inventory.Anchor`. Nothing about
    /// a 40-hex string in a YAML file says where it came from, though, so
    /// "generated" survives only as long as something re-derives it and
    /// compares. That is this rule, and it is the same shape as
    /// `SchemaCorrespondence`: two artifacts that must agree, checked by
    /// regenerating one from its inputs rather than by inspecting either.
    ///
    /// **What a finding here means.** Either a pin was hand-edited in the
    /// workflow — which is the failure the whole design exists to catch,
    /// since a typed pin is a floating ref that merely looks fixed — or
    /// the recorded inputs advanced and the workflow was not regenerated.
    /// Those are opposite causes with the same remedy: regenerate.
    ///
    /// **Applicability, and why absence is not a finding.** A repository
    /// with no recorded manifest claims no trust anchor, and this rule
    /// returns nothing for it. That is a deliberate, narrow exemption:
    /// the rule runs fleet-wide, where the overwhelming majority of
    /// repositories are consumers that never pin CI sources, and a rule
    /// that failed all of them would be turned off within the day. It is
    /// safe *because it is the manifest that is absent* — a repository
    /// that records an anchor is held to it completely, and every
    /// uncertainty from that point on is a finding rather than a pass: a
    /// manifest that cannot be read, a workflow that is not there, a
    /// workflow that will not parse, a step that is missing, a step that
    /// differs, and a checkout that does not precede its own identity
    /// check.
    ///
    /// The last of those is not pedantry. The identity check reads what
    /// git actually placed in the workspace; run before its checkout it
    /// reads a previous job's tree or nothing at all, and reports success
    /// either way.
