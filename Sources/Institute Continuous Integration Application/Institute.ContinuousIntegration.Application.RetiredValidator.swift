/// The transitional bridge that keeps the fixture corpus fully gated
/// while the port is only partly done.
///
/// `.github/scripts/tests/run.sh` used to run the whole corpus, and
/// it cannot survive a single Python deletion: leave a deleted
/// script's dispatch arm and it invokes a path that no longer exists;
/// remove the arm and the rule directory becomes an unregistered
/// rule, which `run.sh` prints as `SKIP` and exits `1` on, by design.
/// There is no per-class edit that keeps it green, so it is retired
/// here in favour of `GitHub.ContinuousIntegration.Validation.Harness` — its Swift owner since
/// C0.
///
/// Retiring it moves one problem: the harness only runs *registered*
/// validators, so during the port the rule directories nobody has
/// ported yet would stop being exercised at all. A gate that silently
/// narrows as the port proceeds is worse than the one it replaced.
/// So the `validate-fixtures` face runs the harness for every ported
/// rule and the retired script for every rule that is not — the same
/// registry-driven dispatch `validate-base.yml` performs over live
/// repositories, applied to the corpus.
///
/// **This table is scaffolding and it shrinks to nothing.** Every
/// entry is deleted by the class that ports its rule, in the same
/// pull request as the script; when the last one goes, so does this
/// file. Nothing else may consult it, and nothing may be added to it.
