    ///   required-check *context* depends on whether it is public or
    ///   private. This is NOT a third top-level `RepositoryClass` case —

    ///   to shadow at `ci / ci-ok`, swift-institute/.github#276 Task 1-04).

    ///   control-plane receipt, Task 2-01/2-02, swift-institute/.github#253)
    ///   instead — it never runs the public universal chain at all

    /// - `protectedMainPrivatePayload` — the private contract: requires
    ///   exactly `verification / workspace`. No compatibility variant
    ///   ever existed because no prior producer preceded it — Phase 2 is
    ///   what first gives private repositories any CI attestation at all.
    ///
    /// The `rulesets` job classifies each target repository mechanically
    /// (root `Package.swift` present ⇒ package; absent ⇒ control;
    /// `Policy/ruleset-class-overrides.json` wins over the mechanical
    /// probe — swift-institute/.github#200/#266) and, for the package
