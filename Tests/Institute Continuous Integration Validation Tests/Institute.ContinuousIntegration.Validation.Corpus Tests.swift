/// real fixture corpus copied into a private temporary root, and each
/// scenario must meet the expectation its directory declares. The copy keeps
/// setup for Git-backed fixture subjects independent of other test suites.
///
/// The corpus here is the *non-owned* remainder of the retired shared
/// corpus: the nineteen GitHub-mechanics rule directories moved to
/// swift-foundations/swift-github-continuous-integration with their
/// validators; everything else — the Institute-policy directories this
/// registry owns plus the port residue with no Swift owner yet — moved
/// here. The residue is counted and named, never silently skipped.
